i dont like this message you added

Actually What the fuck did you say to me you fucking misogynist? Friendly reminder: I graduated at the top of my gender studies class, and I've been involved in privilege checking with over 150 confirmed genders. Iâ€™m trained in patriarchal deconstruction and I was the most oppressed person in my entire upper middle class high school. You are nothing to me but another cultural appropriator. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which have never been seen on this side of your safe space, mark my words. You think you can get away with disagreeing with me on tumblr? Think again, cis scum. As we speak I'm gathering a list of your triggers with my self-diagnosed squad of PTSD specialists, so you better be prepared to deal with some serious privilege checking. I AM LITERALLY AS TRIGGERED AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE RIGHT NOW. I can be anywhere, at any time, and I can give you over seven hundred reasons why you should fuck yourself with a cactus. Not only am I extensively trained in social justice, but I have access to an entire arsenal of sociological blog articles to prove my point and I will use them to wipe your deeply problematic face off the earth you little shit. If only you had known what oppressed retribution your offensiveness would unleash then maybe you would have held your fucking tongue and just killed yourself instead, but you didn't. Stay safe, shitlord.
